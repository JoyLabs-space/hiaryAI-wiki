    }
  ]

This guide demonstrates how to use the built-in human-in-the-loop support in the SDK to pause and resume agent runs based on human intervention.

The primary use case for this right now is asking for approval for sensitive tool executions.

## Approval requests

You can define a tool that requires approval by setting the `needsApproval` option to `true` or to an async function that returns a boolean.

<Code
  lang="typescript"
  code={toolApprovalDefinition}
  title="Tool approval definition"
  meta={`{10}`}
/>

### Flow

1. If the agent decides to call a tool (or many) it will check if this tool needs approval by evaluating `needsApproval`.
2. If the approval is required, the agent will check if approval is already granted or rejected.
   - If approval has not been granted or rejected, the tool will return a static message to the agent that the tool call cannot be executed.
   - If approval / rejection is missing it will trigger a tool approval request.
3. The agent will gather all tool approval requests and interrupt the execution.
4. If there are any interruptions, the [result](/openai-agents-js/guides/result) will contain an `interruptions` array describing pending steps. A `ToolApprovalItem` with `type: "tool_approval_item"` appears when a tool call requires confirmation.
5. You can call `result.state.approve(interruption)` or `result.state.reject(interruption)` to approve or reject the tool call.
6. After handling all interruptions, you can resume execution by passing the `result.state` back into `runner.run(agent, state)` where `agent` is the original agent that triggered the overall run.
7. The flow starts again from step 1.

## Example

Below is a more complete example of a human-in-the-loop flow that prompts for approval in the terminal and temporarily stores the state in a file.

<Code
  lang="typescript"
  code={humanInTheLoopExample}
  title="Human in the loop"
/>

See [the full example script](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-js/tree/main/examples/agent-patterns/human-in-the-loop.ts) for a working end-to-end version.

## Dealing with longer approval times

The human-in-the-loop flow is designed to be interruptible for longer periods of time without keeping your server running. If you need to shut down the request and continue later on you can serialize the state and resume later.

You can serialize the state using `JSON.stringify(result.state)` and resume later on by passing the serialized state into `RunState.fromString(agent, serializedState)` where `agent` is the instance of the agent that triggered the overall run.

That way you can store your serialized state in a database, or along with your request.

### Versioning pending tasks

<Aside>
  This primarily applies if you are trying to store your serialized state for a
  longer time while doing changes to your agents.
</Aside>

If your approval requests take a longer time and you intend to version your agent definitions in a meaningful way or bump your Agents SDK version, we currently recommend for you to implement your own branching logic by installing two versions of the Agents SDK in parallel using package aliases.

In practice this means assigning your own code a version number and storing it along with the serialized state and guiding the deserialization to the correct version of your code.
